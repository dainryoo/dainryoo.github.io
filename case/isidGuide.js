I, along with 19 other designers from all over the country and all kinds of backgrounds, spent 10 weeks at the Design Studio in Austin, Texas.</p> <p>The interns were split into small groups and assigned a project for the summer. Our team, Team Code Blue, was made up of a visual designer, a UX designer, a UX researcher, and another front-end developer. While most other teams were assigned internal IBM projects, we were paired with the International Society of Infectious Diseases (ISID). ISID had reached out to IBM in hopes of developing a solution to <b>empower healthcare workers practicing infection prevention and control (IPC) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)</b>. ISID has a Guide to Infection Control in the Healthcare Setting, in both print and PDF form, but it isn't accessible and has problems reaching people in LMICs. ISID needed a prototype to present at the 2018 International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance in order to get funding to develop the solution we designed.</p>"

        title: "Oh boy that's a huge problem space",
        content: "<p>We were thrown into a domain that none of us had any experience with. We spent a few days researching, scrambling to understand the world of IPC, the types of healthcare workers, and their unique pain points. Initially, we narrowed in on the community healthcare workers (CHW) of sub-Saharan Africa. These CHWs are personnel trusted by their communities, responsible for very \"on the field\" work and yet armed with less than ideal education and resources.</p> <p>We were blinded by our idealism, so drawn to the idea that we could design a solution to reach millions of people, especially the people in LMICs who needed help the most. The fact that these CHWs mostly carried feature phones and lived in areas with little to no Internet were not obstacles in our eyes but exciting challenges to overcome.</p> <p>Slowly we realized that this was not feasible. We had less than two months to interview CHWs in vastly different time zones and with unreliable cell signals; the developers had never done mobile development before, much less development for feature phones or for users with spotty Internet.</p>"

        title: "Our solution",
        content: "<p>And so we, a little reluctantly, let go of all the research (and the oddly emotional connection we had made with the CHW persona) and settled on something more realistic. <b>Our final idea was to design a mobile application that organized the ISID Guide into a more readable and searchable format, as well as supported localized content-creation by infection control specialists on a hopsital level.</b></p>"

        content: "<p>I had come in as a front-end developer, but the intensely collaborative nature of the internship let me explore the other disciplines and work closely alongside the designers on our team. But after enjoying a few weeks of design thinking, brainstorming, and researching, it was time I returned to the world of development.</p> <p>We settled on using <b>React Native</b> for our platform agnostic solution; we barely had time to make one app, much less two different versions for Android and iOS. I had never worked with React Native (not even React!) before, so I spent about a week bodyslamming myself into videos and textbooks and online tutorials.</p>"
