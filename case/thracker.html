                    <h4>Part 0. The problem</h4>
                    <p>Before 2017, the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) Theater Group did not have a database, neither physical nor digital, for their inventory; instead they relied on human memory to hold the details and whereabouts of their items. As a team of five CS students, our task is to create an <b>accessible application to store and display information about UAH's costumes and props</b> in a year.</p>
                    <h4>Part 1. The users</h4>
                    <p>The intended users of the application are the students and staff involved in the UAH Theater Group, especially those who manage the costumes and props. We expect our users will not have the technical knowledge to work with raw data or databases, but will be able to easily use a website or mobile application that presents the raw data in a user-friendly manner. The users expect us to <b>digitize all the theater's items</b> and their details (e.g. images, states of repair, barcodes, reservations) while displaying this large amount of information without being overwhelming and in a clean and coherent manner, primarily designed for use on smartphones to provide <b>portable access to the database</b>. We created a simple <a href="../media/thracker_persona.png" target="_blank">user persona</a> for a student volunteer of the theater group.</p>
                    <p>Our team ultimately decided that we would create a <b>responsive website</b> rather than a mobile app. This solved the issue of having to develop separately for Android and iOS users, and a website could even be easily accessed on a computer. In fact, some users may prefer using a computer over typing into a smaller phone screen, especially if inputting large amounts of data.</p>

                        </div>

                    <p>I used Photoshop and InVision to create a prototype of our application. At this point, we still hadn't decided between a web or mobile app, but we knew we wanted a mobile-friendly design. You can view the <a href="https://invis.io/G6BID2ITN#/222682879_Login" target="_blank">prototype</a> here. After conducting an <b>evaluation</b> of our prototype with some other students, we discovered that it <b>violated a couple of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">Jakob Nielsen's Usability Heuristics</a></b>.</p>
                    <p>1) Buttons that are unable to be pressed do not appear so and users are misled into believing they can interact with these unavailable buttons. This violated the Visibility of System Status (#1) and Match between the System and the Real World (#2) heuristics.</p>
                    <p>2) There are <b>no confirmation, notification, or error messages</b>. The prototype accepts user input without question (no <i>"Are you sure you want to delete/cancel?"</i> messages) and quietly changes screens without letting the user know if the input was successfully accepted or not. This violated the Visibility of System Status (#1) and Error Prevention (#5) heuristics.</p>
                    <p>3) We have <b>no help/documentation pages</b>, only an overly simplisitic tutorial on how to use the site on the home page. I think my initial belief was that our app design would be simple and straightforward enough for users to be able to jump right into. I was trying so hard to reduce clutter, but there is an important <b>difference between minimalism and lack of information to guide the user</b>. We would need a separate page to more thoroughly cover and explain the many features of our application, especially but not just for new users. This violated the Help and Documentation (#10) heuristic.</p>
                    <p>4) Searching and filtering is not intuitive. The separation of the two functions into different screens confused the users. This violated the Visibility of System Status (#1) and Match Between the System and the Real World (#2) heuristics.</p>
                    <p>5) The search bar area on the top of our screen holds a hamburger menu holding user information/settings and a "Filter" button that leads to the search filter screen. While we as the developers knew what exactly was under each menu, the test users found it <b>difficult to remember what each button was for</b>. This violated the Recognition Rather than Recall (#6) and Flexbility of Ease of Use (#7) heuristics.</p>
                    <p>6) Navigation buttons were inconsistently and not intuitively placed. This violated the Match Between System and the Real World (#2) and Consistency and Standards (#4) heuristics.</p>
                    <p>7) Wordings in headers between screens are also inconsistent. This violated the Consistency and Standards (#4) heuristic.</p>
                    <p>8) Users didn't know how to do a "blank search," or how to view all the items in the database. This violated the Match Between the System and the Real World (#2) and Help and Documentation (#10) heuristics.</p>
                    <p>9) There is no way to prevent invalid input (e.g. inputting a date in a format the prototype wouldn't understand). This violated the Error Prevention (#5) heuristic.</p>
                    <h4>Part 3. Final product</h4>
                    <p>The final application is to be completed by May 2018.</p>
