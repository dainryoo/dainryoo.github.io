          <h3>Lukewarm Greeting Cards (2017)</h3>
          <p>Created by myself in ~9 hours for Pearl Hacks 2017, 
          Lukewarm Greeting Cards is a responsive website that randomly pieces 
          together half-hearted messages for various holidays/occasions.</p>

        <h3>Georgia Tech Red Cross (2016)</h3>
        <p>Completely redesigned Georgia Tech's Red Cross website with my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/GTHumaniTech/about/">HumaniTech</a> 
        team; I was assigned the home page and focused on making the site mobile-friendly. 
        Additional requirements were to have Google Calendar and Facebook Like button plugins.</p>

        <h3>Sapling Academia (2016)</h3>
        <p>A fake quiz website made for my web development class that stores questions/answers and 
        student scores in a database. Students can take quizzes for different subjects, and teachers
        can view their results. Sadly, it's not complete, but I learned to use very basic PHP 
        for data retrieval and storage, as well as some D3 for data visualization.</p>

        <h3>Roombae (2016)</h3>
        <p>Created with a team for HackGT 2016, Roombae was envisioned to be a roommate searching web app.
        Although I was able to finish most of the front-end, we unfortunately couldn't implement any of the back-end.</p>

        <p>I made art and animated sprites for some games by Georgia Tech's
        <a href="http://vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/profile/dryoo/">VGDev Club</a>, 
        collaborated with <a href="http://cottontrek.tumblr.com/">cottontrek</a> to create 
        <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/badboxart/games/lone-survivor-fury-brush/136437">Lone Survivor: FURY BRUSH</a>,
         and have a couple tiny games I've made myself.</p>
